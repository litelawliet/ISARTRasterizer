# ISARTRasterizer
This is a rasterizer we made at ISART Digital Montreal in first year within one month. This is a very basic rasterizer using SDL2 made by a group of 3 students. I'm currently working on a newer version of this Rasterizer using SFML on another repository : https://github.com/litelawliet/Rasterizer
